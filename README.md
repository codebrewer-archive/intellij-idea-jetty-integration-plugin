# Old Jetty Integration Plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA

This plug-in has not been maintained since JetBrains added support for Jetty
in IntelliJ IDEA 10.5.

If you don't have IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (required for the JetBrains
plug-in) then perhaps [IDEA Jetty Runner](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7505-idea-jetty-runner/)
will meet your needs.

The historical `master` branch is available in the `unmaintained` branch.
